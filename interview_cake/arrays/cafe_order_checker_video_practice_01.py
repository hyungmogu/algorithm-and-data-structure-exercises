# Cafe Order Checker
#
# My cake shop is so popular, I'm adding some tables and hiring wait staff so
# folks can have a cute sit-down cake-eating experience.
#
# I have two registers: one for take-out orders, and the other for the other
# folks eating inside the cafe. All the customer orders get combined into one
# list for the kitchen, where they should be handled first-come, first-served.
#
# Recently, some customers have been complaining that people who placed orders
# after them are getting their food first. Yikesâ€”that's not good for business!

# To investigate their claims, one afternoon I sat behind the registers with my
# laptop and recorded:

# The take-out orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (take_out_orders)
# The dine-in orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (dine_in_orders)
# Each customer order (from either register) as it was finished by the kitchen. (served_orders)
# Given all three lists, write a function to check that my service is first-come,
# first-served. All food should come out in the same order customers requested it.

# We'll represent each customer order as a unique integer.

# As an example,
#

#   Take Out Orders: [1, 3, 5]
#   Dine In Orders: [2, 4, 6]
#   Served Orders: [1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 3]
# would not be first-come, first-served, since order 3 was requested before
# order 5 but order 5 was served first.

# But,

#   Take Out Orders: [1, 3, 5]
#   Dine In Orders: [2, 4, 6]
#   Served Orders: [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6]
#
# would be first-come, first-served.
#
# Input
#   - list of integers x 3
# Output
#    - Boolean
#
# Constraints
#   - there can be extra orders at the end of the day (len(take_out_orders) or len(dine_in_orders) > len(served_orders))
#
#
#
#   Take Out Orders: [1, 3, 5]
#                        x
#   Dine In Orders: [2, 4, 6]
#                             x
#   Served Orders: [1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 3]
#                                     ^
