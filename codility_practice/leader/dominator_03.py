# Dominator
# https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/8-leader/dominator/
#
# An array A consisting of N integers is given. The dominator of array A is the
# value that occurs in more than half of the elements of A.
#
#
# For example, consider array A such that
#
#  A[0] = 3    A[1] = 4    A[2] =  3
#  A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = -1
#  A[6] = 3    A[7] = 3
# The dominator of A is 3 because it occurs in 5 out of 8 elements of A (namely
# in those with indices 0, 2, 4, 6 and 7) and 5 is more than a half of 8.
#
# Write a function
#
# def solution(A)
#
# that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns index of any element
# of array A in which the dominator of A occurs. The function should return âˆ’1
# if array A does not have a dominator.
#
# For example, given array A such that
#
#  A[0] = 3    A[1] = 4    A[2] =  3
#  A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = -1
#  A[6] = 3    A[7] = 3
# the function may return 0, 2, 4, 6 or 7, as explained above.
#
# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
#
# N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].

# ================ solution =======================
# you can write to stdout for debugging purposes, e.g.
# print("this is a debug message")
#
# goal:
#   - return index of any element of array A in which the dominator of A occurs

# known
#   - dominator is value that occurs more than half of elements in A
#
# case
#   1. N == 0 --> return -1
#   2. N == 1 --> return 0
#
#
# pseudocode
#   1. count elements in A
#   2. for each key in A, if number is greater than half of A, return key
#   3. otherwise, return -1
#
# time complexity O(N), spatial complexity O(N)
